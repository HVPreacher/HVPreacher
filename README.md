- 👋 Hi, I’m @HVPreacher
- 👀 I’m interested in studying theology and practicing and teaching it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the relation of middle ages literature and art forms and church doctrine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on studies on theological literature and its affect on church life and liturgy.
- 📫 I'm usually reached through email at ddcop54@gmail.com and generally accessible at www.drcopeland.org
